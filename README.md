# CSS
This repository is a personal space to practice and experiment with CSS. Here, I upload everything I learn, from small exercises to full component experiments.

What You’ll Find Here

- Layouts: Flexbox, Grid, and responsive designs
- Styling Exercises: Buttons, cards, menus, forms, and more
- Animations & Effects: Hover effects, transitions, and keyframe animations
- Miscellaneous Practice: Any new CSS concept I’m learning

Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and maintain a collection of CSS practice exercises I can refer back to anytime.
